Take a look at the following graph, it illustrates the ever-growing number of mobile phone users across the world, which brings out the importance of mobile security.   The estimated number of mobile devices is around 5.8 billion, which is thought to have grown exponentially within five years and is supposed to reach nearly 12 billion within four years. Hence, it will be an average of two mobile devices per person on the planet. This makes us fully dependent on mobile devices with our sensitive data being transported all over. As a result, mobile security is one of the most important concepts to take in consideration. Mobile Security as a concept deals with the protection of our mobile devices from possible attacks by other mobile devices, or the wireless environment that the device is connected to.      1.    Mobile Security  Introduction Mobile Security  2   Following are the major threats regarding mobile security:  Loss of mobile device. This is a common issue that can put at risk not only you but even your contacts by possible phishing.   Application hacking or breaching. This is the second most important issue. Many of us have downloaded and installed phone applications. Some of them request extra access or privileges such as access to your location, contact, browsing history for marketing purposes, but on the other hand, the site provides access to other contacts too. Other factors of concern are Trojans, viruses, etc.   Smartphone theft is a common problem for owners of highly coveted smartphones  such as iPhone or Android devices. The danger of corporate data, such as account credentials and access to email falling into the hands of a tech thief is a threat.  Mobile Security  3  By definition, an Attack Vector is a method or technique that a hacker uses to gain access to another computing device or network in order to inject a bad code often called payload. This vector helps hackers to exploit system vulnerabilities. Many of these attack vectors take advantage of the human element as it is the weakest point of this system. Following is the schematic representation of the attack vectors process which can be many at the same time used by a hacker.  Some of the mobile attack vectors are:  Malware o Virus and Rootkit o Application modification o OS modification   Data Exfiltration o Data leaves the organization o Print screen o Copy to USB and backup loss   Data Tampering o Modification by another application o Undetected tamper attempts o Jail-broken devices   Data Loss o Device loss o Unauthorized device access  o Application vulnerabilities  2.   Mobile Security  Attack Vectors  Mobile Security  4  Consequences of Attack Vectors Attack vectors is the hacking process as explained and it is successful, following is the impact on your mobile devices.  Losing your data: If your mobile device has been hacked, or a virus introduced, then all your stored data is lost and taken by the attacker.    Bad use of your mobile resources: Which means that your network or mobile device can go in overload so you are unable to access your genuine services. In worse scenarios, to be used by the hacker to attach another machine or network.   Reputation loss: In case your Facebook account or business email account is hacked, the hacker can send fake messages to your friends, business partners and other contacts. This might damage your reputation.   Identity theft: There can be a case of identity theft such as photo, name, address, credit card, etc. and the same can be used for a crime. Anatomy of a Mobile Attack Following is a schematic representation of the anatomy of a mobile attack. It starts with the infection phase which includes attack vectors.  Infecting the device Infecting the device with mobile spyware is performed differently for Android and iOS devices. Android: Users are tricked to download an app from the market or from a third-party application generally by using social engineering attack. Remote infection can also be performed through a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, where an active adversary intercepts the users mobile communications to inject the malware. iOS: iOS infection requires physical access to the mobile. Infecting the device can also be through exploiting a zero-day such as the JailbreakME exploit. Installing a backdoor To install a backdoor requires administrator privileges by rooting Android devices and jailbreaking Apple devices. Despite device manufacturers placing rooting/jailbreaking detection mechanisms, mobile spyware easily bypasses them: Android: Rooting detection mechanisms do not apply to intentional rooting. Mobile Security  5  iOS: The jailbreaking community is vociferous and motivated.  Bypassing encryption mechanisms and exfiltrating information Spyware sends mobile content such as encrypted emails and messages to the attacker servers in plain text. The spyware does not directly attack the secure container. It grabs the data at the point where the user pulls up data from the secure container in order to read it. At that stage, when the content is decrypted for the users usage, the spyware takes controls of the content and sends it on. How Can a Hacker Profit from a Successfully Compromised Mobile? In most cases most of us think what can we possibly lose in case our mobile is hacked. The answer is simple - we will lose our privacy. Our device will become a surveillance system for the hacker to observer us. Other activities of profit for the hacker is to take our sensitive data, make payments, carry out illegal activities like DDoS attacks. Following is a schematic representation. Mobile Security  6   OWASP Mobile Top 10 Risks  When talking about mobile security, we base the vulnerability types on OWASP which is a not-for-profit charitable organization in the United States, established on April 21. OWASP is an international organization and the OWASP Foundation supports OWASP efforts around the world.  For mobile devices, OWASP has 10 vulnerability classifications. M1-Improper Platform Usage This category covers the misuse of a platform feature or the failure to use platform security controls. It might include Android intents, platform permissions, misuse of TouchID, the Mobile Security  7  Keychain, or some other security control that is part of the mobile operating system. There are several ways that mobile apps can experience this risk. M2-Insecure Data This new category is a combination of M2 and M4 from Mobile Top Ten 2014. This covers insecure data storage and unintended data leakage. M3-Insecure Communication This covers poor handshaking, incorrect SSL versions, weak negotiation, clear text communication of sensitive assets, etc. M4-Insecure Authentication This category captures the notions of authenticating the end user or bad session management. This includes:  Failing to identify the user at all when that should be required  Failure to maintain the user's identity when it is required  Weaknesses in session management M5-Insuficient Cryptography The code applies cryptography to a sensitive information asset. However, the cryptography is insufficient in some way. Note that anything and everything related to TLS or SSL goes in M3. Also, if the app fails to use cryptography at all when it should, that probably belongs in M2. This category is for issues where cryptography was attempted, but it wasn't done correctly. M6-Insecure Authorization This is a category to capture any failures in authorization (e.g., authorization decisions in the client side, forced browsing, etc.) It is distinct from authentication issues (e.g., device enrolment, user identification, etc.) If the app does not authenticate the users at all in a situation where it should (e.g., granting anonymous access to some resource or service when authenticated and authorized access is required), then that is an authentication failure not an authorization failure. M7-Client Code Quality This was the "Security Decisions Via Untrusted Inputs", one of our lesser-used categories. This would be the catch-all for code-level implementation problems in the mobile client. That's distinct from the server-side coding mistakes. This would capture things like buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and various other code-level mistakes where the solution is to rewrite some code that's running on the mobile device. M8-Code Tampering This category covers binary patching, local resource modification, method hooking, method swizzling, and dynamic memory modification. Mobile Security  8  Once the application is delivered to the mobile device, the code and data resources are resident there. An attacker can either directly modify the code, change the contents of memory dynamically, change or replace the system APIs that the application uses, or modify the application's data and resources. This can provide the attacker a direct method of subverting the intended use of the software for personal or monetary gain. M9-Reverse Engineering This category includes analysis of the final core binary to determine its source code, libraries, algorithms, and other assets. Software such as IDA Pro, Hopper, otool, and other binary inspection tools give the attacker insight into the inner workings of the application. This may be used to exploit other nascent vulnerabilities in the application, as well as revealing information about back-end servers, cryptographic constants and ciphers, and intellectual property. M10-Extraneous Functionality Often, developers include hidden backdoor functionality or other internal development security controls that are not intended to be released into a production environment. For example, a developer may accidentally include a password as a comment in a hybrid app. Another example includes disabling of 2-factor authentication during testing.            Mobile Security  9  An authenticated developer of a company creates mobile applications for mobile users. In order to allow the mobile users to conveniently browse and install these mobile apps, platform vendors like Google and Apple have created centralized market places, for example, PlayStore (Google) and AppStore (Apple). Yet there are security concerns.  Usually mobile applications developed by developers are submitted to these market places without screening or vetting, making them available to thousands of mobile users. If you are downloading the application from an official app store, then you can trust the application as the hosting store has vetted it. However, if you are downloading the application from a third-party app store, then there is a possibility of downloading malware along with the application because third-party app stores do not vet the apps.  The attacker downloads a legitimate game and repackages it with malware and uploads the mobile apps to a third-party application store from where the end users download this malicious gaming application, believing it to be genuine. As a result, the malware gathers and sends user credentials such as call logs/photo/videos/sensitive docs to the attacker without the user's knowledge.  Using the information gathered, the attacker can exploit the device and launch any other attack. Attackers can also socially engineer users to download and run apps outside the official apps stores. Malicious apps can damage other applications and data, sending your sensitive data to attackers. App Sandboxing Issues  Sandbox helps the mobile users by limiting the resources that an application uses in the mobile device. However, many malicious applications can overpass this allowing the malware to use all the device processing capabilities and user data. Secure Sandbox  It is an environment where each application runs its allocated resources and data so the applications are secure and cannot access other application resources and data. Vulnerable Sandbox It is an environment where a malicious application is installed and it exploits the sandbox by allowing itself to access all data and resources.  3.   Mobile Security  App Stores & Security Issues  Mobile Security  10  Take a look at the following screenshot. You might have received a similar SMS which seemed to be genuine. In fact, after a bit of analysis, we realize it is not genuine. It is an example of SMS phishing.  The links in the SMS may install malware on the users device or direct them to a malicious website, or direct them to call a number set up to trick them into divulging personal and financial information, such as passwords, account IDs or credit card details. This technique is used a lot in cybercrimes, as it is far easier to trick someone into clicking a malicious link in the e-mail than trying to break through a mobiles defenses. However, some phishing SMS are poorly written and clearly appear to be fake. Why SMS Phishing is Effective? SMS Phishing is successful because it plays with the fear and anxiety of the users. Irrational SMS instills fear in the mind of the users. Most of the scenarios have to do with the fear of losing money, like someone has purchased something using your credit cards.  Other instances include, the fear when an SMS accuses you of doing something illegal that you havent done. Or an SMS regarding the possibility of harming your family members.  of your family, etc.    4.   Mobile Security  Mobile Spam  Mobile Security  11  SMS Phishing Attack Examples  Now let us see a few examples to understand the cases where SMS Phishing mostly happens. Example 1 Generally, scammers use email to SMS to spoof their real identity. If you google it, you may find many legitimate resources. You just google search: email to SMS providers       Mobile Security  12  Example 2 The other classical scam is financial fraud which will ask you for PIN, username, password, credit card details, etc.  Example 3 Spelling and bad grammar. Cyber criminals generally make grammar and spelling mistakes because often they use a dictionary to translate in a specific language. If you notice mistakes in an SMS, it might be a scam.  Mobile Security  13  Example 4 SMS phishing attempt to create a false sense of urgency.  Example 5 Cybercriminals often use threats that your security has been compromised. The above example proves it well. In the following case, the subject says you have won a gift.   Mobile Security  14  Example 6 In this case, an SMS asks you to reply so that they can verify that your number is valid. This can increase the number of SMS spams in your number.  Example 7 Spoofing popular websites or companies. Scam artists use the name of big organizations that appear to be connected to legitimate websites but actually it takes you to phony scam sites or legitimate-looking pop-up windows.  Mobile Security  15  Prevention and Solutions  In order to protect ourselves from SMS phishing some rules have to be kept in mind.  Financial companies never ask for personal or financial information, like username, password, PIN, or credit or debit card numbers via text message.   Smishing scams attempt to create a false sense of urgency by requesting an immediate response. Keep calm and analyze the SMS.   Dont open links in unsolicited text messages.    Dont call a telephone number listed in an unsolicited text message. You should contact any bank, government, agency, or company identified in the text message using the information listed in your records or in official webpages.   Dont respond to smishing messages, even to ask the sender to stop contacting you.   Use caution when providing your mobile number or other information in response to pop-up advertisements and free trial offers.    Verify the identity of the sender and take the time to ask yourself why the sender is asking for your information.   Be cautious of text messages from unknown senders, as well as unusual text messages from senders you do know, and keep your security software and applications up to date. Pairing Mobile Devices on Open Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Connections  Bluetooth is a similar radio-wave technology, but it is mainly designed to communicate over short distances, less than about 10m or 30ft. Typically, you might use it to download photos from a digital camera to a PC, to hook up a wireless mouse to a laptop, to link a hands-free headset to your cellphone so you can talk and drive safely at the same time, and so on.  To obtain this connection, devices exchange each others PIN, but in general as a technology it is not secure. It is a good practice to repair the devices after a period of time. What a hacker can do with a paired device?  Play sounds of incoming call  Activate alarms  Make calls  Press keys  Read contacts  Read SMS Mobile Security  16   Turn off the phone or the network  Change the date and time  Change the network operator  Delete applications Security measures for Bluetooth devices  Enable Bluetooth functionality only when necessary.  Enable Bluetooth discovery only when necessary.  Keep paired devices close together and monitor what's happening on the devices.  Pair devices using a secure passkey.  Never enter passkeys or PINs when unexpectedly prompted to do so.  Regularly update and patch Bluetooth-enabled devices.  Remove paired devices immediately after use.
